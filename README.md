# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. Clone the Repository or Extract the ZIP:<br>
   git clone https://github.com/Aashi32/React-Dashboard
<li>
<ul>If you have cloned the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project directory.<br></ul>
<ul>If you have downloaded the ZIP file, extract it to your preferred directory.<br></ul>
</li>
2. Install Node.js and npm:

<li> 
  <ul>Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from nodejs.org.</ul></li>
3. Install Project Dependencies:<br>
